### Session 10: Contact examples
Learn about contact interaction functions, including standardized functions for spring-like cell-cell adhesion. 
See an example inspired by developmental biology where cells aggregate and link to form "worms" that travel 
collectively up chemical gradients. In the special contact functions, linked cells use a signal that diffuses 
across cell junctions to determine if they are head, middle, or tail cells. **(approx 50 min)**
