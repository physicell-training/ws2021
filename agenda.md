# 2021 PhysiCell Workshop and Hackathon Agenda
This is the official, full agenda for the 2021 PhysiCell Workshop and Hackathon. 
**last updated:** Sunday, July 18, 2021

Events marked "E" are exclusive to accepted participants. All others are publicly accessible. Wherever possible, we will post full slides and video recordings for all sessions.


## Pre-Workshop Activities 
#### Set up PhysiCell 
Read and follow the appropriate guide for your operating system, found at: 

https://github.com/physicell-training/ws2021

Linux users can most likely skip setup g++ and Python setup, but should download PhysiCell 1.9.0 to test that they can compile and run the sample projects. See either the Windows or MacOS guide for details. 

We will continue to hold virtual office hours for testing your setup as noted in the workshop email. You can also get setup help in our dedicated Slack workspace. 

#### Join the PhysiCell slack workspace 
We use a dedicated Slack workspace for annoucements, troubleshooting, and other (asynchronous) community activities. Join at: 

https://join.slack.com/t/physicellcomm-sf93727/shared_invite/zt-qj1av6yd-yVeer8VkQaNDjDz7fF00jA 

#### Join the GatherTown space (E)
We will use GatherTown as our virtual conference space, particularly to help navigate between zoom rooms for the virtual hackathon and breakout sessions. 

(Details to come!)
