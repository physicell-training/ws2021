# 2021 PhysiCell Workshop and Hackathon Agenda
This 

Events marked "E" are exclusive to accepted participants. All others are publicly accessible. Wherever possible, we will post full slides and video recordings for all sessions.

## Pre-Workshop Activities 
#### Set up PhysiCell 
Read and follow the appropriate guide for your operating system, found at: 

https://github.com/physicell-training/ws2021

Linux users can most likely skip setup g++ and Python setup, but should download PhysiCell 1.9.0 to test that they can compile and run the sample projects. See either the Windows or MacOS guide for details. 

We will continue to hold virtual office hours for testing your setup as noted in the workshop email. You can also get setup help in our dedicated Slack workspace. 

#### Join the PhysiCell slack workspace 
We use a dedicated Slack workspace for annoucements, troubleshooting, and other (asynchronous) community activities. Join at: 

https://join.slack.com/t/physicellcomm-sf93727/shared_invite/zt-qj1av6yd-yVeer8VkQaNDjDz7fF00jA 

#### Join the GatherTown space (E)
We will use GatherTown as our virtual conference space, particularly to help navigate between zoom rooms for the virtual hackathon and breakout sessions. 

(Details to come!)

## Monday, July 26: Day 1 (All times US Eastern)
### 11-11:15. Welcome and Introduction
Welcome participants, give the overall format, and discuss goals for the week. 

### 11:15-12:15. Session 2: First PhysiCell Dive
Give an introduction to modeling with PhysiCell using built-in sample projects, including basic data visualization and data access in Jupyter notebooks. 

### 12:15-13:00. Break
Take a virtual coffee break in GatherTown to mix and meet with your fellow participants. 

### 13:00-13:45. Session 3: Introduction to Cell Phenotype in PhysiCell (Part 1). 
Learn about cell phenotype in PhysiCell. Modulating cell phenotype in response to microenvironmental and other signals is key to agent-based modeling in PhysiCell. 

### 13:45-14:00. Break
Take a virtual coffee break in GatherTown to mix and meet with your fellow participants. 

### 14:00-14:45. Session 4: Introduction to Cell Phenotype in PhysiCell (Part 2). 
Learn about cell phenotype in PhysiCell. Modulating cell phenotype in response to microenvironmental and other signals is key to agent-based modeling in PhysiCell. 

### 14:45-15:30. Break
Take a virtual coffee break in GatherTown to mix and meet with your fellow participants. 

### 15:30-17:00. Session 5: A complete example (interactive)
Work through a complete modeling example from start to finish. This session will focus on defining multiple cell definitions in a model of clonal competition in a tumor. This model can be built completely through XML markup via a graphical interface with no additional C++. 

### 17:00-17:15. Break
Take a virtual coffee break in GatherTown to mix and meet with your fellow participants. 

### 17:15-17:50. Brainstorming Round 1 (E)
Start brainstorming for hackathon projects with your fellow workshop participants. 

### 17:50-18:00. Day 1 wrap-up
Discuss the day's progress and set the stage for Day 2. 

### 18:00-19:00. (Optional) (E). 
Please use GatherTown to continue getting to know your fellow participants. 

### Asynchronous. Session 6: Introduction to Custom Variables, Parameters, and C++ searches
Learn about how to work with custom cell variables and user parameters. Learn how to search for and access custom variables, user parameters, cell definitions, and microenvironment substrates from within C++ in a PhysiCell project. 

To reduce Zoom fatigue sessions like this have been moved to asynchronous to watch at your own convenience. Please watch prior to the start of synchronous Day 2 activities.

## Tuesday, July 27: Day 2 (All times US Eastern)

### Asynchronous. Session 6: Introduction to Custom Variables, Parameters, and C++ searches
Learn about how to work with custom cell variables and user parameters. Learn how to search for and access custom variables, user parameters, cell definitions, and microenvironment substrates from within C++ in a PhysiCell project.

### 11-11:15. Welcome and Day's Goals
Discuss the day's goals.

### 11:15-12:30. Session 7: Functions in PhysiCell
Learn how to write custom C++ cell functions in PhysiCell, and use them to write dynamical cell phenotype that varies with microenvironmental conditions. This is the basis for turning your cell biological hypotheses into agent rules that can dynamicaly change cell phenotype in response to signals. 

### 12:30-13:00. Break
Take a virtual coffee break in GatherTown to mix and meet with your fellow participants. 

### 13:00-14:00. Session 8: Chemical Communication in PhysiCell
Learn how to use diffusible signals for chemical communication and coordination between cell agents. 

### 14:00-14:15. Break
Take a virtual coffee break in GatherTown to mix and meet with your fellow participants. 

### 14:15-14:30. Summary of Day 1 Brainstorming (E)
We will present clustering of main ideas generated in Round 1 brainstorming to prepare for continued project brainstorming. 

### 14:30-15:00. Brainstorming Round 2 (E)
Continue to generate and refine project ideas. 

### 15:00-15:30. Present Brainstorming Round 2 (E)
Briefly summarize the refined brainstorming for each group. 

### 15:30-16:00. Break
Take a virtual coffee break in GatherTown to mix and meet with your fellow participants.
